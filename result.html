        <p style="vertical-align: text-bottom;"><br><br><br><br>Drone's motor orientation or layout.<br>The most common and versatile configuration of a quadcopter is in either X or + layout, which is best for most applications. The hexacopter or octocopter configuration applies to drones that need to transport heavy payloads, such as professional aerial photography rigs. These give extra stability and redundancy important for safety. While coaxial motors do exist for certain specialized designs, such as Y6 or X8 configurations, where one motor is mounted above another in an effort to achieve increased thrust within a compact frame, some drone designs include pusher configurations wherein the propellers are mounted behind the motors for certain aerodynamic advantages.</p>
